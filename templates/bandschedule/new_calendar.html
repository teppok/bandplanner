				A short help:<br>
				
				<P>This software addresses a very specific kind of scheduling problem:
				Take a band with a relatively small amount of members. This band wants to
				schedule a gig some time in the near or far future, but some of the members
				may have restrictions on days that are acceptable. Most days they are able
				to move their other arrangements.</P>
				
				<P>Using this little calendar, band members can let others know which days
					are bad for them, maybe a month or two into the future, so if a possible
					date for a gig is offered, it can be accepted without asking each separate
					member for a confirmation.</P>
					
				<P>Create a calendar with any descriptive string.
					Copy the url of the calendar you receive to a safe location -- if you lose the url, you lose the calendar.
					You should share the url to other users.
					Then type in your username and click on the days to turn them red. When you're quite
					sure you have finished a month, click on the checkbox to let others know that this
					month is good to go.</P>
				
				<P>When arranging the gig, open the calendar. From the list at the bottom you'll see 
					if all members have finished filling out the
					month (so you can be sure that this information is valid and complete), 
					and you see the days where some member can't make it as yellow.</P>

				Note that the program might be a little slow at times, because of a slow network connection.
